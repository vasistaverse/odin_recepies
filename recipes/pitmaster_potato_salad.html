        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>2 1/4 pounds large Yukon gold potatoes</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon Dijon mustard</li>
                <li>1/4 cup apple cider vinegar</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons rice wine vinegar</li>
                <li>1/3 cup vegetable oil</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more to taste</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
                <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
                <li>1/4 cup diced red onion</li>
                <li>1/4 cup diced celery</li>
                <li>1/4 cup diced dill pickles</li>
                <li>1/4 cup diced roasted sweet red peppers</li>
                <li>1/4 cup thinly sliced chives or green onion</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Nest potatoes directly in hot coals in a charcoal grill. Surround potatoes with coals for even roasting. Roast until charred, 6 to 7 minutes. Turn potatoes and continue to roast until deeply charred outside and tender inside, 6 to 7 minutes more.</li>
                <li>Remove potatoes to a bowl, cover with foil, and let cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes. Refrigerate until chilled, at least 1 hour, or preferably overnight.</li>
                <li>Combine Dijon mustard, cider vinegar, rice wine vinegar, vegetable oil, salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper in a bowl for the dressing and whisk thoroughly.</li>
                <li>Scrape, peel, or cut off any fully charred surface of potato, leaving some dark brown bits for a deeper flavor. Cut potatoes into 1/4-inch to 1/2-inch size pieces.</li>
                <li>Add potatoes to dressing, along with red onion, celery, dill pickles, and red peppers. Toss well with a spatula until evenly mixed. Cover; refrigerate for at least 3 hours before serving, or up to overnight. </li>
                <li>Add chives, mix well, and season to taste with salt and pepper before serving.</li>
            </ol>
